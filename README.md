# twitter-scraper
Revised version of https://github.com/marquisvictor/Optimized-Modified-GetOldTweets3-OMGOT to get tweets like twitter data format
# Prerequisites
pyquery
# Why this?
The project I mentioned above, runs on terminal and returns csv file as output. The advantages of this revision are:
1. Getting tweets like twitter data format though you don't have any access token!
2. Media attachments included(except video type)
3. Prepares full text of tweets
